# Current protocol phase.
# Valid values: THESIS, ANTITHESIS, SYNTHESIS, EXECUTION
phase: THESIS

# The model currently leading the phase.
# Valid values: Claude, Codex
# Thesis/Synthesis -> Claude; Antithesis/Execution -> Codex
owner_model: Claude

# The model blocking consensus, if any.
# Set to Claude or Codex when one side blocks progress.
# null when no consensus issue exists.

# Overall protocol status.
# OK              -- normal operation
# BLOCKED         -- a blocker prevents phase transition
# CONSENSUS_BLOCKED -- agents cannot agree; System Owner intervention required
